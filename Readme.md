docbook5-style-xsl
---
This is a Arch Linux package that installs some DocBook5 [schemas](http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl-ns/) not supported by package docbook-xsl-ns, primarly for use in [colord](https://github.com/hughsie/colord). It is a modification of [docbook-xsl-ns](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/docbook-xsl-ns/) and thus they conflict. 

After cloning, you can install it with [makepkg](https://www.archlinux.org/pacman/makepkg.8.html). (`makepkg -sri`)
